# Jira Board

IMPORTANT *** PLEASE MAKE A NEW BRANCH INSTEAD OF MAKING CHANGES DIRECTLY ON MAIN (ex. CIN-12)
command in terminal to use to create a new branch for the ticket = " git checkout -b CIN-{ticket_num} "

Using the Jira software we can manage aour work and organize it so we all are on the same page

When loggin in, you will see on the left side of the screen a tab that says "Board"
Click on the tab and it will bring you to the SCRUM board

There are 4 columns in the SCRUM board (To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done)
Although these are fairly self explanitory, to do is where we will store tickets created that need to be completed, in progress means that someone is working on that ticket,
review means that someone has finished their work and want others to take a second look at it, and done means the ticket is finished and can be merged to the main branch
